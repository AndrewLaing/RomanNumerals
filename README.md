# RomanNumerals
An update of the RomanNumerals class from my SykesCottagesTest repo. New methods have been added to the class along with more unit tests.<br /><br />
The new methods include add, subtract, multiply, divide, equals and compare which allow basic mathematical operations and comparisons to be performed upon the numeral.
